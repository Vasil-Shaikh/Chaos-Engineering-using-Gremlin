# ACG_Project_Embrace_The_Chaos
Service outages can result in huge revenue losses and reputational damage to organizations. So how can you reduce the risk of downtime? The answer lies in chaos engineering. Join Faye Ellis in this ACG Project and build a website using EC2 instances, Cognito, and DynamoDB, then use Gremlin Free to break your system. You’ll take down a single server, create network black holes, overload the CPU, and even simulate an AWS AZ or region failure, and observe the impacts. By triggering failures intentionally in a controlled way, you can be confident your systems can deal with those failures before they occur (especially in the middle of the night, when you least expect it). Let’s unleash the gremlins and embrace the chaos!
